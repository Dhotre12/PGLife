# How to Run Code with Apache
To run the code, you will need to start Apache first. Apache is a web server that is used to serve web pages. You can start Apache by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Type the following command:
sudo service apache2 start
3. Press Enter.
Once Apache is started, you can go to the following URL in your web browser:

http://127.0.0.1/PGLife
This will open the PGLife web page.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

* The IP address 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address. This means that it refers to the same computer that you are using.
* The URL http://127.0.0.1/PGLife is the address of the PGLife web page.
* If you are using a different operating system, the commands to start Apache may be different.
